AI dev assistant goal: starter for static site plus FastAPI plus gRPC MCP plus SQLite on GCP. All guidance lives in .vibe/*.md and docs/.

Focus:
- app/ backend and SQLite snapshot
- static-site/ minimal UI calling HTTP JSON
- pipeline/ builds PostgreSQL hypergraph from markdown and can export SQLite
- tutorials/linkedin/ bootstrap profile markdown from saved profile.html

Keep .vibe/STATUS.md up to date.

Roadmap: use `docs/roadmap.md` for human readers and `.vibe/ROADMAP.md` for AI helpers.
